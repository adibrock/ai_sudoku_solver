• 16 – the 16x16 sudoku

heuristics_combinations can be
• 1 - Arc consistency, Forward checking, By order, Random value
• 2 - Forward checking, By order, Random value
• 3 - Forward checking, MRV, Least constraining value
• 4 - Arc consistency, By order, Random value
• 5 - Arc consistency, MRV, Least constraining value
• 6 - Arc consistency, Forward checking, MRV, Least constraining value

If you would like to use Local search on the easy 9x9 sudoku, run the command-

For stochastic beam search - Sudoku LCL beam

For random-restart hill climbing - Sudoku LCL RR
